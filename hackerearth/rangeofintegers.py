# Write a program to list all the integers between two integers L and R (including L and R). L and R can be any integer between 1 and 100
# Instructions:

#     We have defined the integer variables L and R for you.
#     We have provided the code to get inputs for the variables.
#     Print all the integers between L and R (including L and R) with space between them

# Sample Input:
# L = 5, R = 10

# Sample Output:
# 5 6 7 8 9 10

# Get L and R from the input
L, R = map(int, input().split())

# Write here the logic to print all integers between L and R
for i in range(L, R + 1):
    print(i, end=' ')
