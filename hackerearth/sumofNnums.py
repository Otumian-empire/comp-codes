# Write a program to print the sum of all the elements of an array of size N where N can be any integer between 1 and 100. 
# Instructions:

#     We have defined an integer variable N for you.
#     We have provided the code to get the input for variable N.
#     We have defined an integer array 

#     .
#     We have provided the code to get the input for the array elements.
#     You have to write the logic to add the array elements.
#     Print the sum.

# Sample Input:
# N = 3
# Array = 6 3 8

# Sample Output:
# 17
N = input()

# Get the input
numArray = map(int, input().split())

sum_integer = 0
# Write the logic to add these numbers here

for i in numArray:
    sum_integer += i

# Print the sum
print(sum_integer)
